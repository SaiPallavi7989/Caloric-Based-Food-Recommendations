#Caloric Based Food Recommendations

This project focuses on developing a food recommendation system tailored for individuals with different body types: bulk, lean, and maintenance. The system utilizes Python and machine learning techniques, specifically the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm, to provide personalized dietary suggestions based on caloric needs.

Overview:

The goal of this project is to assist users in achieving their dietary goals by recommending foods that align with their caloric intake requirements. This is particularly useful for those looking to bulk up, maintain their current weight, or lean down. The system analyzes user inputs, including their body type and daily caloric needs, to generate suitable meal suggestions.

Libraries Used:

The following Python libraries are essential for implementing the recommendation system:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: For numerical operations.

Scikit-Learn: For implementing the KNN algorithm and handling machine learning tasks.

Matplotlib: For creating visualizations to analyze the dataset and results.

Seaborn: For creating attractive and informative statistical graphics.

KNN Algorithm

The KNN algorithm is employed to classify food items based on their nutritional content and similarity to the user's preferences. The process involves the following steps:

Data Collection: Gather nutritional information about various food items, including calories, macronutrients, and portion sizes.

Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis, ensuring that all relevant features are included.

Model Training: Use the KNN algorithm to train the model on the dataset. The model learns to identify food items that best match the user's caloric needs based on their body type.

Recommendation Generation: When a user inputs their body type, the model returns a list of recommended foods that meet these criteria.


Conclusion

This caloric-based food recommendation system is designed to help users make informed dietary choices based on their body type and caloric needs. By leveraging the KNN algorithm and a user-friendly interface, individuals can easily find suitable meal options to support their health and fitness goals.
